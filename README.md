# HLTH629 Final Project Proposal - 3D Objects in 3D - Visualizing Geographical Data Maps in AR

Due Date: October 30th by 5pm
Rachel Woo r3woo@uwaterloo.ca

### Description:

I will be visualizing geographical data maps in mobile AR. Why topography. Why ar for topography

. Of course, this data visualization area is thematically larger than just topographical maps. AR, mobile devices, visualizing 3D Any geographically denoted data. Mention from textbook shape importance. 

#### Actions and Targets
#### Threats and Validations 
#### Colour 

### Personal Expertise:

I donâ€™t have particular expertise currently in topographical maps, however, my thesis is focusing on immersive experiences in AR. I will be using this project to explore different implementations of AR and its implications for data vis. 

### Data Collection: 

data on background checks of people attempting to buy firearms.

I will be visualizing geographic data on background checks for people attempting to buy firearms. 

For simplicity I will be only analyzing from September 2010 to September 2020 in the continental United States. 

Exclude Guam, Hawaii, Alaska, Mariana Islands, Peurto rico, rhode island, virgin islands

I am going to try to keep this relatively simple and not overcomplicate things: 

Parse Data
Generate AR object
Install Apple AR SDK and get mock up working on phone
View different AR objects on phone 

Push Goals: 

Around 2 pages. 

#### Previous Work 

#### Milestones and Schedule 

Your proposal should include:
1. A project title
2. The names and email addresses of everyone on the team
3. A description of your research problem
4. Personal expertise. If you have expertise in that area, brie y describe it: anywhere from \this
ties in with a project I'm doing for another course" to \I've been interested in this area for
years, so I read about it occasionally" to \I don't know the area at all, but this seems like an
interesting problem."
5. Your proposed approach. You should include your study design or which language and platform(s) you will use if programming is involved, and whether you will use any pre-existing software or toolkits. Be as detailed here as possible, so that Prof. Wallace can give you constructive feedback and help you maximize the likelihood of a successful study during the term.
6. Previous work. While this section will not be as complete as in your nal report, you should begin to discuss what has been done in this area. Your bibliography can include both academic work and any relevant commercial tools. Be sure to explain if your project aims to replicate or build on this existing work, and why that's an interesting research problem.
7. Milestones and schedule. Include a list of project milestones, breaking down the work into a series of smaller chunks. Milestones must be associated with target dates. The course syllabus may provide some helpful guidance here, but do not feel that you must match what is outlined there.
